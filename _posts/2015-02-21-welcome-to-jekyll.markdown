Over ten years ago, I wrote a speech for my high school graduation. I thought
it would be interesting have it kickstart this blog, which has been in the
making for almost six years now. I have not watched myself give this speech in
a very long time and instead of suffering through the cringeworthy experience
of watching my 18-year-old, thumb-ring-wearing self in order to transcribe
what I actually said, I decided to include an updated version of the original
text. Aside from reducing the ridiculous number of ellipsis I presumably
used to indicate pauses, the revision below is pretty faithful to what I
actually said in the ceremony.
