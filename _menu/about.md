I am a developer and entrepreneur working on several software engineering
projects. I'm passionate about MongoDB and am a teaching assistant for two of
their online courses:

 - [M101P: MongoDB for Python Developers](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M101P/about)
 - [M102: MongoDB for DBAs](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M102/about)

I received my AB from Harvard University, completed intensive studies in
Computer Science and Statistics at Stanford and a Master's in Computing
at Imperial College London. While in college I was one of
the co-founders of [Vostu](http://vostu.com), back when it was a social network
for Latin America. I started my professional career at Sotheby's and then
founded [Newertown](http://newertown.com), a creative arts consultancy firm
that helped emerging artists and arts startups engage audiences through
digital media. We were involved in the production of
[The Future of a Promise](http://edgeofarabia.com/exhibitions/the-future-of-a-promise),
the first major Pan-Arab arts exhibition at the Venice Biennale and
[We Need to Talk](http://edgeofarabia.com/exhibitions/we-need-to-talk-jeddah),
the first large-scale contemporary art exhibition in Jeddah. I was also
director of [mimanzana](http://mimanzana.com), a digital marketing firm based
in Lima, Peru, and cofounder of [Boxagon](http://boxagon.com) a social
commerce website that helped people find bundles of products for travel
and sports activities.

I write, take photographs, make music, curate, design and program. You can
find me on Twitter, GitHub, StackOverflow, Instagram, Pinterest and several
other social media sites.
