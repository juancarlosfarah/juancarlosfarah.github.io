I am a developer and entrepreneur working on several software engineering
projects. I'm passionate about MongoDB and am a teaching assistant for two of
their online courses:

 - [M101P: MongoDB for Python Developers](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M101P/about)
 - [M102: MongoDB for DBAs](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M102/about)

I received my Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Harvard University, 
completed intensive studies in Computer Science and Statistics at Stanford 
University and a Master of Science in Computing at Imperial College London. 
While in  college I was one of the co-founders of [Vostu](http://vostu.com), 
back when  it was a social network for Latin America. I started my 
professional career  at Sotheby's and then founded [Newertown](http://newertown.com),
a creative  arts consultancy firm that helped 
emerging artists and arts startups engage  audiences through digital media. 
We were involved in the production of
[The Future of a Promise](http://edgeofarabia.com/exhibitions/the-future-of-a-promise),
the first major Pan-Arab arts exhibition at the Venice Biennale and
[We Need to Talk](http://edgeofarabia.com/exhibitions/we-need-to-talk-jeddah),
the first large-scale contemporary art exhibition in Jeddah. I was also
director of [mimanzana](http://mimanzana.com), a digital marketing firm based
in Lima, Peru, and co-founder of [Boxagon](http://boxagon.com), a social
commerce website that helps people find bundles of products for travel
and sports activities.

I write, take photographs, make music, curate, design and code. You can
