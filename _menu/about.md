I am a developer and entrepreneur currently pursuing an Masters in Computer
Science at Imperial College London. I'm passionate about MongoDB and am a
teaching assistant for two of their online courses:

 - [M101P: MongoDB for Python Developers](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M101P/about)
 - [M102: MongoDB for DBAs](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M102/about)

I received my AB from Harvard University and completed intensive studies in
Computer Science and Statistics at Stanford. While in college I was one of
the co-founders of Vostu, back when it was a social network for Latin America.
I started my professional career at Sotheby's and then founded Newertown, a
creative arts consultancy firm that helped emerging artists and arts startups
engage audiences through digital media. We were involved in the production of
[The Future of a Promise](http://edgeofarabia.com/exhibitions/the-future-of-a-promise),
the first major Pan-Arab arts exhibition at the Venice Biennale and
[We Need to Talk](http://edgeofarabia.com/exhibitions/we-need-to-talk-jeddah),
the first large-scale contemporary art exhibition in Jeddah. At present I'm
director of [mimanzana](http://mimanzana.com), a digital marketing firm based
in Lima, Peru, and work on several software engineering projects as a
freelancer.
