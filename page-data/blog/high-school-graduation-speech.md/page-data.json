And it's a trend that happens with everything. Your high school\nfriends will be shadows among the ones to come. Your teachers will merely be\nghosts and most of your peers, just silhouettes barely recognizable against the\nwhite background of your life here at Roosevelt. I sure hope that would never\nhappen. I convince myself it won't, but believe me, it will. You will try to\nkeep in touch and promise each other you will visit every now and then. But even\nyou know in the back of your mind, that you probably will never do it. And it is\nreally sad to think that people, friends who were with you every single day,\nwill be out of your life forever. And you will walk out of this room, maybe\nwith the person you care about the most next to you, with the melody of a\ngraduation song you don't even like in your head, with the hopes of becoming\nsomething great in the years to come... hopes that are simply intangible threads\nof optimism that will break whenever you try to get a hold of them. And even\nthough we all might leave this room full of hope... that hope won’t take us\nanywhere.</p>\n<p>We live in a time that tells us that most of us will get divorced and that\ncancer will take the lives of the majority of our classmates. There will be a\nfew fatal car crashes, a couple cases of alcoholism, a good number of drug\naddicts, and what the heck, maybe even one or two suicides. That is life. It is\nnot that happy walk in the park that most of us dream of whenever we dare to\nlook into the future. There is tragedy, there is pain, there is death. Yes, you\nwill have to wake up and work some day, and feel really bad whenever the money\nyou earn is not enough to pay for the phone bill your teenage daughter spends\ntalking to her boyfriend. And yes you will cry... whenever you find out your\nlittle boy is going to spend a night in jail for possession of cocaine.\nYou will cry.</p>\n<p>But the beauty of it all, is that we are young, full of energy and immortal.\nWhat do we care right now that the person standing next to us will have a\nmid-life crisis 40 years from now? What do we care that all the girls in our\nclass will have really bad cases of menopause and make their husbands' lives\nhell in their later years? We just don't worry about that kind of stuff.</p>\n<p>Because eventually the future will come, and we can't do anything about it.\nRight now we don't know who'll be rich, who'll be healthy, who'll be poor,\nwho'll be sick, who'll die and who'll live. We can't control that. However,\nwhat we can control is that some of us will have a great time tonight and party\nuntil we almost feel like dying. And now, at the peak of our youth, we can drink\nand we can smoke and get in fights, cry, jump, laugh, kiss, sleep, dance, fall\nand get up again... we can do everything. And all those cancers, and all those\ndeaths, and all those addictions, will seem so far away.</p>\n<p>That's the beauty of it all, people. Live the moment, enjoy it, put it in a\nlittle box, and treasure it. Those who do that will succeed. Those who do that\nwill be able to look at the pictures, at the love letters, at the wrapped\nsouvenirs of their youth, and they will remember. They'll smile and they'll cry\nand remember that once upon a time there was the class of 2004... a class feared\nby teachers and students. I mean they dreaded us. We might all go to hell just\nfor what we did in high school... but whatever, it was worth it.</p>","excerpt":"High School Graduation Colegio Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lima, Peru June 2004 Ladies and Gentlemen, I cannot fight the fact that someday…","timeToRead":3,"fields":{"slug":"/blog/high-school-graduation-speech.md/"},"frontmatter":{"tags":null,"author":null,"title":"High School Graduation Speech","updatedDate":null,"image":null}},"recents":{"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/acentos/"},"timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"Acentos","image":null,"author":{"id":"Juan Carlos Farah","avatar":{"children":[{"__typename":"ImageSharp","fixed":{"src":"/static/66894e485b32df63e46fdee2ea832555/29d9a/juancarlos.jpg","srcSet":"/static/66894e485b32df63e46fdee2ea832555/29d9a/juancarlos.jpg 1x,\n/static/66894e485b32df63e46fdee2ea832555/1a035/juancarlos.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/66894e485b32df63e46fdee2ea832555/74d54/juancarlos.jpg 2x"}}]}}}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/ángeles/"},"timeToRead":3,"frontmatter":{"title":"Ángeles","image":null,"author":{"id":"Juan Carlos Farah","avatar":{"children":[{"__typename":"ImageSharp","fixed":{"src":"/static/66894e485b32df63e46fdee2ea832555/29d9a/juancarlos.jpg","srcSet":"/static/66894e485b32df63e46fdee2ea832555/29d9a/juancarlos.jpg 1x,\n/static/66894e485b32df63e46fdee2ea832555/1a035/juancarlos.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/66894e485b32df63e46fdee2ea832555/74d54/juancarlos.jpg 2x"}}]}}}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/high-school-graduation-speech/"},"timeToRead":3,"frontmatter":{"title":"High School Graduation Speech","image":null,"author":{"id":"Juan Carlos Farah","avatar":{"children":[{"__typename":"ImageSharp","fixed":{"src":"/static/66894e485b32df63e46fdee2ea832555/29d9a/juancarlos.jpg","srcSet":"/static/66894e485b32df63e46fdee2ea832555/29d9a/juancarlos.jpg 1x,\n/static/66894e485b32df63e46fdee2ea832555/1a035/juancarlos.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/66894e485b32df63e46fdee2ea832555/74d54/juancarlos.jpg 2x"}}]}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/high-school-graduation-speech.md/"}}}
