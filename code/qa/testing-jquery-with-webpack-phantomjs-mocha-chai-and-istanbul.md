Every time I read an article or tutorial about front end testing, it usually 
comes with the disclaimer that in-browser testing is hard. Over the few days 
I spent preparing my latest project's front end testing framework I saw this 
warning so often I actually made a point of forgetting about everything that 
required a DOM until everything else had been done. When that day came, I 
quickly realised that those disclaimers are very well founded. In-browser 
testing is hard. More specifically, it is complex. It involves a lot of moving 
parts and given that front end technologies change often, tutorials are quickly 
outdated. My personal experience browsing the internet for answers motivated me
to write this short article about how I ended up structuring my test and test
coverage frameworks. 

Coming soon!
