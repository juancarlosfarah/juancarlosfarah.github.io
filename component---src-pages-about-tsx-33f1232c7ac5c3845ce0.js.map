For five years, I\n            was a Teaching Assistant for MongoDB, a NoSQL database company, working with\n            the company's core education team to teach, promote and translate courses that\n            introduce MongoDB to Python developers and database administrators. Over the past\n            two years, I have worked as a Researcher and Software Engineer at the Interaction\n            Systems Group (REACT) at EPFL. At REACT, I am the technical lead for the Graasp\n            Ecosystem, a suite of native and web applications that support digital education\n            activities and are the core technology behind the Horizon 2020 Next-Lab and GO-GA\n            European Innovation Action Projects. Alongside my technical work, I conduct research\n            focusing on privacy-preserving systems for technology-enhanced learning using\n            blockchain-based solutions. I also give a yearly lecture on trust, privacy and\n            reputation frameworks for social media platforms, as part of the Social Media course\n            (EE-593). Finally, I am a Member of the Board of Experts of the College of Engineering\n            and Architecture of Fribourg, where I supervise Bachelor projects.\n          </p>\n        </Segment>\n      </Container>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default withLayout(AboutPage);\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
